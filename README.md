This code provides a simple HTML table with sorting functionality on its headers and a search bar for filtering its data.

Instructions for Use:

The data for the table is fetched from an API endpoint and is automatically displayed in the table.
Users can sort the data in each column by clicking on the corresponding header.
The "Find robot" search bar allows users to filter the table by robotId.

Optional Enhancements:

Adding information about the distance to the charging/staging area.
Adding a column to show the idle time or performance of each robot.
Adding a column to identify if a robot is broken, needs maintenance, or is out of service.
